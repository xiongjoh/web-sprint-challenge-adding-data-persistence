# Adding Data Persistence Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Data Persistence**. During this sprint, you studied **RDBMS, including SQL, multi-table queries, and data modeling**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **a database based on given specifications**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

Review the folder structure of this project. _Do not **move or rename any of the files** that are already included in this project._

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._

## Introduction

In this project you will be given a set of requirements and must design a database to satisfy them. As a part of this process you'll also build an API with endpoints to access the data.

### Entities

A **project** is what needs to be done and is stored in a `projects` table. We want to store the following data about a project:

- [ ] `id` - unique
- [ ] `name` - required
- [ ] `description` - optional
- [ ] `completed` - cannot be `NULL` and has a default value of `false`

A **resource** is anything needed to complete a project and is stored in a `resources` table. We want to store the following data about a resource:

- [ ] `id` - unique
- [ ] `name` - required and unique
- [ ] `description` - optional

A **task** is one of the steps needed to complete a project and is stored in a `tasks` table. We want to store the following data about a task:

- [ ] `id` - unique
- [ ] `description` - required
- [ ] `notes` - optional
- [ ] `completed` - cannot be `NULL` and has a default value of `false`

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
Relational Databases are pre tables of data that can call other data in, SQL is used to query such data and create new tables from the databases.
2. Why do tables need a Primary Key?
Tables need a primary key to identify the entries, and normalize the data
3. What is the name given to a table column that references the Primary Key on another table?
Foreign key
4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables?
We need a juncition table to be made, where we connect the other two tables with foreign keys
## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository. (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch.
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ ] Design the data model and use _knex migrations_ to create the database and tables needed to satisfy the following business rules:
  - [ ] a `project` can have multiple `tasks`.
  - [ ] a `task` belongs to only one `project`.
  - [ ] a `project` can use multiple `resources`. Examples of `resources` are: computer, conference room, microphone, delivery van.
  - [ ] the same `resource` can be used in multiple `projects`.
  - [ ] when adding `projects` the client must provide a name, the description is optional.
  - [ ] when adding `resources` the client must provide a unique name, the description is optional.
  - [ ] when adding a `task` the client must provide a description, the notes are optional.
  - [ ] when adding a `task` the client must provide a `project_id` that points to the `id` of an existing project.
  - [ ] for `projects` and `tasks` if no value is provided for the `completed` property, the API should provide a default value of `false`.
- [ ] Build an API inside the `api` folder with endpoints for:
  1. adding a new resource - `[POST] /api/resources`
  2. retrieving all resources - `[GET] /api/resources`
  3. adding a new project - `[POST] /api/projects`
  4. retrieving all projects - `[GET] /api/projects`
  5. adding a new task - `[POST] /api/tasks`
  6. retrieving all tasks - `[GET] /api/tasks` **Each task must include `project_name` and `project description` so you will need to join tables**

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

**IMPORTANT:** Work on stretch goals in a **new branch**. You can branch off `<firstName-lastName>` by executing `git checkout -b stretch`.

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Add an endpoint to get a list of project resources.
- [ ] Add an endpoint to get a list of project tasks.
- [ ] Add an endpoint to see all projects using a particular resource.

## Submission format

There are two possible ways to submit this project to Canvas. Lambda Staff will let you know which one applies:

1. Submitting a pull request to merge `<firstName-lastName>` (or `stretch` if you finished any stretch goals) branch into `main`.
2. Setting up your fork settings on Github to submit via Codegrade by pushing commits to your `<firstName-lastName>` branch.
